# PendantDropTensiometry
Project to determine the critical micellular concentration of SDS within a water droplet

Intro: Surfactants will occupy the boundary between a polar and a non-polar medium. There is however a critical concentration where it is more energetically favourable for the surfactant to form micelles when the boundary between the two mediums is saturated with the surfactant.
